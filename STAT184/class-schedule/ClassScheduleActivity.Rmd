# Class Schedule

### STAT 184: Introduction to R Programmaing

R is a powerful, open-source programming language used widely for applications in statistics and data science. Students will be expected to access, join, wrangle, clean, and visualize real data. The course will emphasize use of "tidyverse" R packages (e.g. dplyr, ggplot2), although students will also be exposed to Base R and other packages. The course focuses on descriptive and graphical summary techniques rather than inferential statistical techniques. You can find more details in this [link](https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/stat/).
