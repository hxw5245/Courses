# Activity: Popular Names


## Instructions 
- You will complete the Popular Names Activity found in the DataComputing eBook <https://dtkaplan.github.io/DataComputingEbook/project-popular-names.html#project-popular-names>  
    - **Important**: 
        - You will choose at least four (4) names for the activity
        - One name must be you (even if there is no data for your name)
        - The other three names can be anything you like (three names must have data in `BabyNames`)
        - The plot shown at the beginning is the **goal** for the end of the activity, **NOT** the first task in the activity.
    - every step in the activity should have narrative text describing your observations; many steps also require code chunks and corresponding output.
    - you should make commits in GitHub as you complete the activity
- create a new R Notebook in your GitHub Repository
- submit the completed R Notebook as HTML to Canvas before deadline

## Tips

- **always write descriptive commit messages** 
- Make sure you run all code chunks in your R Notebook before you "preview" the HTML document.  
- Make sure the HTML document that you submit to Canvas has rendered properly and is human readable!
