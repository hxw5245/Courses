# Activity: Graph Replication

## Activity

Reproduce plots for Problem 5.2 & Problem 5.3 in the DC Exercises, and then explore the `diamonds` data loaded with the `ggplot2` R package.

Each plot must be reproduced using the `ggplot2` syntax.  In order to accomplish this task, you may use an interactive graph builder tool.  Modify the graph builder tool until you are satisfied, and then capture the `ggplot2` syntax.

**IMPORTANT:** There is starter code available in the file "GraphReplication.Rmd"... the graphs you are supposed to replicate appear as ".png" files, but **your task is to produce `ggplot2` R code** that produces an identical graph directly (not a reference to a static image file or screenshot). 

*Note: you can either use the interactive graphics commands from the `DataComputing` package or a similar function called `mplot()` from the`mosaic` package.*

## Grading

Assignment is worth a total of 10 points:

- [3 points] Problem 5.2 graph replication 
- [3 points] Problem 5.3 graph replication  
- Exploration of `diamonds` data  
    - [1 point] `ggplot2` expression that successfully produces a graphical display of the `diamonds` data.  
    - [1 point] graphic must display at least 3 variables from the `diamonds` data.  
    - [2 points] written narrative describing something learned/observed about the `diamonds` data using your graphic.
